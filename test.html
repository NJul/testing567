  <h1>Question 1</h1>

  I was just trying to commit changes to the Git master.
  From what I have read, it seems that the idea is to delete the lock file.
  The message says:

  make sure no other Git processes are running and remove the file manually

  Perhaps someone knows, which file to remove and how to remove?

  <h2>Answer 1</h2>
  Removing the index.lock file like Schwern stated will solve this problem.

  You can remove it by running <strong>rm -f ./.git/index.lock</strong>

  The rm command is used to remove (delete) files and directories.

  The -f stands for force which tells your computer to remove the files without prompting for confirmation.
